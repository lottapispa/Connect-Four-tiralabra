# Weekly report 6

### Hour Reporting
| **date** | **time (h)** | **what I did** 
| --------- | ----------- | --------- 
| 24.8 | 3.5 | Started weekly report, coding and testing class score, updating documentation
| 26.8 | 3.5 | Fixed code based on last week's feedback and issue 2, changing and testing class gameloop
| 27.8 | 4.75 | Finishing minimax, testing, updating documentation
| total: | 12.75

### Progress
Core functionality is almost done. Testing isn't where I would like it to be.

### Problems
Having trouble figuring out how to link function choose_best_move to minimax and whether to call minimax in function choose_best_move or the other way around. I'm also wondering how to give priority to center columns while still blocking opponents connect four in class score.

### Questions
Right now my program makes it look like the player wins after the first move and I don't really know why it does that? What kind of performance evaluation/suorituskykytesti is needed in my project? How can I test the time and space complexity of my program?

### What am I doing next
Checking the quality of my code with pylint, performance evaluation, improving test coverage
