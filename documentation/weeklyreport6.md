| total: | x

### Progress
Core functionality is almost done. Testing time complexity isn't where I would like.

### Problems
Having trouble figuring out how to link function choose_best_move to minimax and whether to call minimax in function choose_best_move or the other way around. I'm also wondering how to give priority to center columns while still blocking opponents connect four in class score.

### Questions
What kind of performance evaluation/suorituskykytesti is needed in my project?
