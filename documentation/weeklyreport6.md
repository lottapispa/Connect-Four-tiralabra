# Weekly report 6

### Hour Reporting
| **date** | **time (h)** | **what I did** 
| --------- | ----------- | --------- 
| 24.8 | 3.5 | Started weekly report, coding and testing class score, updating documentation
| 26.8 | x | Fixed code based on last week's feedback and issue 2
| total: | x

### Progress
Core functionality is almost done. Testing time complexity isn't where I would like.

### Problems
Having trouble with function choose_best_move even though score_for_moves seems to be working.

### Questions
What kind of performance evaluation/suorituskykytesti is needed in my project?
