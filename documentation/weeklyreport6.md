| total: | x

### Progress
Core functionality is almost done. Testing time complexity isn't where I would like.

### Problems
Having trouble with function choose_best_move even though score_for_moves seems to be working.

### Questions
What kind of performance evaluation/suorituskykytesti is needed in my project?
