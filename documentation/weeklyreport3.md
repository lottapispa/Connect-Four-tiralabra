# Weekly report 3

### Hour Reporting
| **date** | **time (h)** | **what I did** 
| --------- | ----------- | --------- 
| 4.8 | x | Started coding and testing class gameloop, added checks for wins and tests for them in class gamestatus
| total: | x

### Progress
Main gameloop and it's test class has been done. 

### Problems
I found unit testing for user inputs to be really difficult. Figuring out how to check the rack for wins diagonally was also really hard.

### Questions
Should I add instructions to the game itself before it starts or is it enough to have them in the github repository?
