# Weekly report 3

### Hour Reporting
| **date** | **time (h)** | **what I did** 
| --------- | ----------- | --------- 
| 4.8 | 6.25 | Started coding and testing class gameloop, added checks for wins and tests for them in class gamestatus, started minimax, making testing document
| 6.8 | 2 | Testing, making testing document, improved code quality with pylint suggestions
| total: | 8.25

### Progress
Main gameloop and it's test class has been done. Have started minimax algorithm. Test class to class gamestatus is up to date. Testing document is made. Code quality tool pylint is in use.

### Problems
Figuring out how to check the rack for wins diagonally was really hard. Also hard to find possible next moves, since you have to drop pieces to the bottom or on top of other pieces. I don't really understand how to do unit testing for user inputs.

### Questions
Should I add instructions to the game itself before it starts or is it enough to have them in the github repository user guide?
