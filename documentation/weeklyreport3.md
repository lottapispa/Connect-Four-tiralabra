# Weekly report 3

### Hour Reporting
| **date** | **time (h)** | **what I did** 
| --------- | ----------- | --------- 
| 4.8 | 6 | Started coding and testing class gameloop, added checks for wins and tests for them in class gamestatus, started minimax, making testing document
| x | x | 
| total: | x

### Progress
Main gameloop and it's test class has been done. Have started minimax algorithm. Testing document is made.

### Problems
I found unit testing for user inputs to be really difficult. Figuring out how to check the rack for wins diagonally was also really hard. Also hard to find possible next moves, since you have to drop pieces to the bottom or on top of other pieces.

### Questions
Should I add instructions to the game itself before it starts or is it enough to have them in the github repository user guide?
