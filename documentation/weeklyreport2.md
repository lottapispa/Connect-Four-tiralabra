# Weekly report 2

### Hour Reporting
| **date** | **time (h)** | **what I did** 
| --------- | ----------- | --------- 
| 26.7 | 0.75 | creating codefiles and classes, thinking about the structure of the implementation
| 27.7 | 5.75 | creating new classes, starting to code class gamestatus, by creating the gamerack, initializing poetry, starting testing
| 28.7 | 2 | writing user guide, making the tasks file, adding pylint (like checkstyle for java), continuing to code class gamerack and testing it
| total: | 8.5

### Progress
The code  and testing has been started. No functionality yet. Docstring is used. Pylint has been added.

### Questions
I'm wondering how to decide which player gets to make the first move, or should the AI always go second?
