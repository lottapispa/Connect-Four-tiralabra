# Weekly report 4

### Hour Reporting
| **date** | **time (h)** | **what I did** 
| --------- | ----------- | --------- 
| 9.8 | 4 | Improving class structure after feedback and changed testing with it, started making implementation document and weekly report 4, coding class gameloop, writing the user guide, testing class gameloop
| 13.8 | 5,5 | coding all classes and testing, realized I created a new class instance in many classes so I fixed that, working on implementation and user guide, finished weekly report
| total: | 9.5

### Progress
Mainloop was improved so if a player writes invalid input, the game doesn't stop, but instead just prints an error message and asks again. All classes have been improved specifically to work for minimax. User guide is in good condition. In general I haven't progressed as much as I wanted this week, as I've been busy.

### Problems
Thought about how the gamerack looks when printing it and realized it would look better if the colors were put into the rack as R and Y so it would stay balanced and rows wouldn't be different lengths and columns would be straight. I'm having a hard time with the score and heuristic values. I also had to change classes and testing so they would also work on test gameracks when testing different moves in minimax.

### Questions
Should the depth in minimax be the amount of rows (6) at the start?
