# Weekly report 4

### Hour Reporting
| **date** | **time (h)** | **what I did** 
| --------- | ----------- | --------- 
| 9.8 | x | Improving class structure after feedback and changed testing with it, started making implementation document and weekly report 4, coding class gameloop, writing the user guide
| total: | x

### Progress
Mainloop was improved so if player writes invalid input, the game doesn't stop, but instead just prints an error message and asks again. 

### Problems
Thought about how the gamerack looks when printing it and realized it would look better if the colors were put into the rack as R and Y so it would stay balanced and rows wouldn't be different lengths and columns would be straight.
